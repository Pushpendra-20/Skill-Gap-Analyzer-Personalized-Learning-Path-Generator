# Skill-Gap-Analyzer-Personalized-Learning-Path-Generator
Analyzes skill gaps for a target job role and generates a personalized learning path using Python/JavaScript and CSV datasets.

Skill Gap Analyzer & Learning Path Generator is a student project that helps users understand what skills they need for a specific job role. The user enters their target role and current skills, and the system compares them with role-based skill data to find missing subjects. It then suggests a simple learning roadmap and relevant resources to help the user prepare for the job.
